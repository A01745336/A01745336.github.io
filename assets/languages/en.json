        "description": "I'm a student of Computer Engineering at Tec de Monterrey, Campus Estado de México. Over the years, I have contributed to the development of various school projects that have allowed me to grow as a person and as a computer engineering student. These projects have ranged from simulations in Matlab to the complete development of websites, 2D video games, and Android applications. I've had the opportunity to work on projects with Percussion Arts Society and the Municipio de Atizapán de Zaragoza. I've also contributed to other projects such as simulating a smart warehouse and city using multi-agents in Python and creating graphics in Unity, and a syntactic code highlighter that checks the correct grammar of code using regular expressions in Python."
